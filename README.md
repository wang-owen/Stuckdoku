## Inspiration

Simple games for a beginner hackathon team

## What it does

Generates a random sudoku and lets you fill it out yourself, if you're stuck, simply press the solve button and watch as it fills itself out.

## How we built it

Used Django to pass information around from generating the sudoku board using python to displaying it and interacting with it via Javascript and HTML/CSS

## Challenges we ran into

Creating a new sudoku board with page refresh.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Deeper understanding of web development as well as creating a project with unfamiliar tools.

## What we learned

Tech stacks in web development can be extremely complicated yet powerful

## What's next for Stuckdoku

Polishing and adding a feature where you can upload an image of a sudoku for the site to solve.
